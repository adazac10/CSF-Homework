Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926293 for sample 1

Problem 3:

commenting out linenum = 0 causes an error for me
File "dna_analysis.py, line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum +1
NameError: name 'linenum is not defined

I belive if you commeneted out gc_count = 0 it would
also say not defined and thus not work

Problem 4:

sample_1
GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852

small
GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Collaboration:

I helped Houng mostly during class on lab3, no
one worked with on this

Reflection:

I learned that variables are very important
and that I can search by strings and then list
how many I find. I am enjoying programming, only
thing that I wish I knew is the math, that is
hurting, but programming wise I'm good. My advice
for others is go over the code and step by step
see what is going on, then copy paste to edit 
working code to meet your needs.

I don't understand the Diff Checker, what am I 
checking the difference on? Not sure where my 
output from  dna_analysis goes.
